# AI-enhanced Data Analysis Tool (C++)

This project demonstrates how AI-generated insights and UI text
can be integrated into a C++ data analysis application.

## Features
- Simple numerical data analysis
- AI-generated insights (simulated)
- AI-enhanced user interface messages

## Technologies
- C++
- Standard Library (STL)

## Example
The program analyzes numeric data and prints AI-style insights
such as trends, averages, and recommendations.

## Purpose
To show how AI can improve user experience and analysis
without implementing machine learning.
